               <br>
               <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dynamic, self-motivated designer with a robust toolset of skills in UX, UI, interaction design, typography, video production, motion graphics, illustration, writing, and front end design. I am always refining my craft, and enjoy striving for creative
and innovative solutions to whatever puzzle is thrown my way.
               <br>
               <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here&#8217s a little bit about me and my experience. I'm currently working at <a href="http://www.lodestonesocial.com/">Lodestone Social</a> as a UX Designer. Before that I worked at <a href="https://www.kingsisle.com/">KingsIsle Entertainment</a> (a local MMORPG company that serves 45 million users) as a Usability Analyst. I was brought in to work as the lead analyst for their transition from web to mobile, and acted as an assistant producer between departments. Before that I worked as a staff designer for <a href="http://dreamit.com/">Dream It Ventures</a>, a start up accelerator that was rated as one of the best in the nation by Forbes Magazine. When I was going to Brandeis University I was the lead designer for our school&#8217s multi-media center. I redesigned and maintained our library&#8217s CMS website, redesigned our lab&#8217s HTML/CSS website, and created design materials for print and web for campus outreach. 
               <br>
               <br>

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I double majored in Fine Art and Film at Brandeis, my fevor for Interactive Design was kindled while studying at the <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/slade">Slade School of Art in London.</a> After becoming involved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIITIZNfdjs">with some indie hacker groups in London</a>, I focused my fine arts thesis on interactive design in a fine arts installation context. I did all that while also starting my own student-run media company and doing <a href="https://vimeo.com/80128671">the most ambitious and extensive film production thesis</a> that had ever been done at my school before. Interactive Design is a fascinating field, dynamic and filled with untapped potential in a vast possibility space. From mobile apps to VR, from Health/Law to play studies, the future is interactive! 
               <br>
               <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217m a founding member of the Austin Virtual Reality club, a frequent hackathon participant, and the kind of guy who rambles on about the button layouts of microwaves at parties. I&#8217m always looking for a new challenge, if you have a problem that needs solving, give me a shout.
